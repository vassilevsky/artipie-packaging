Scripts and other files for packaging [Artipie](https://www.artipie.com/) for popular enterprise operating systems.

Currently there is only an RPM package primarily for Oracle Linux 9. It could be installed into any other RPM-based distro,
because it has no OS-specfic bindings. It's basically a JAR + SystemD unit.

Packages are published to PackageCloud:
